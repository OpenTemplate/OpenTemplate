project description
    this is a project that creates a framework or template for a new open source project to be ready for contributions immediately. my hypothesis is that a lot of a program is easy to contribute to early on in its creation with the right outline in place. i asked myself what is the minimum required to start an open source project and have people contribute everything. ideally one could just come up with an idea and title and it is ready to be worked on. not even a single line of code. 

and the first project will allow contribution to this very framework, itself. i know this is very meta.

i found when searching for ideas for this many solutions were language or platform specific. this is intended to be high level and simpler. simplicity is key to allow anybody to contribute. ive used a simple directory/file structure with leading directions.

eveything kinda self references so you know what to put where.

i dont know if this makes sense. so first job make it make sense.

contributing..how you can contribute.
directory..explanation of directory structure.
info..what standard information would go in this file.
outline..mission statement, organisation
requirements..dependency information

how you can contribute
